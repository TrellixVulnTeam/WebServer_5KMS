<p>I remember when I was young, love and marriage were these nebulous concepts that would happen some time in my future. I would often wonder or daydream who I would marry, how I would meet her, how we would get engaged, what the wedding would be like, etc., etc. I think this is pretty normal for most young people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I never fantasized about was what life would be like AFTER marriage. I never sat around and thought about how we would fight, how we would share toothpaste, who would take the kids to school, how we would negotiate and compromise, what our fifth anniversary would look like, not to mention&nbsp;our 50th.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s because these things aren&#39;t exciting or sexy. In fact, they&#39;re quite the opposite. They&#39;re quotidian and boring. Yet, they are actually what constitute the majority of a relationship, the majority of love.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My fantasies about love&nbsp;&mdash; like most people&#39;s &mdash; were limited to pretty much the beginning of the life cycle of a relationship. They were filled of romantic visions of sleepless nights filled with wild passionate sex, fun getaways to exciting location, bathtubs full of rose petals and bubbles and shit. It was awesome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But looking back, I was unrealistic about relationships and love.&nbsp;And I think that really screwed me up in a number of ways (if anything, it made me more afraid of commitment, because I thought it was a much bigger deal than it actually was). This has been a topic I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot lately as I&#39;m about a year into my marriage. I wrote up many of the ideas in a new article here:&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also wrote some more stuff, for site members. This time not about rose petals and bad Bon Jovi songs. I&#39;ve been getting emails forever from readers about how I research my articles/books. Some people seem to think reading a few dozen books each year and remembering what was in them is some kind of superhuman feat, so I took some time and wrote out some helpful tips on how to become a better reader and a better learner in general. Students, in particular, may get a lot out of it.&nbsp;</p>
